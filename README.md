# Predestinato: A Tiny Universe Simulator
## About
Welcome to this wacky and borderline useless project, built solely for the purpose of making something fun and seeing the capabilities of Javascript, CSS and HTML. 

## How does this work?
- Click anywhere to spawn planets.
- They orbit a central star, collide, and merge.

## Architecture
Built with:
- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript
- A questionable understanding of physics

## Versioning
### v1 - 245 BC
- In the beginning, the universe was formless and desolate. Then, someone decided it would be a bright idea to bring that universe to you, dear user.
- Basic functionality

### v2 - 12 BC
- Starfield Background 
- Dynamic Background Hue Shift
- Particle Explosions (When planets collide, they create a satisfying burst of particles that inherit the color of the merged planet and fade away).
- Reset Button
- Loader with random planetary facts
- Random UFOs
- Random Satellites
